            <p>Several browser extensions serve as tracker blockers. These extensions prevent advertisers and other third-party services from tracking where and what you browse. We recommend <a href='https://www.eff.org/privacybadger' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Privacy Badger</a> or <a href='https://www.ghostery.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ghostery</a>. Some ad-blocking services may have this feature as well.</p>
